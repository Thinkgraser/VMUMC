        <p>
          March! Spring will arrive this month. The seasons are changing and it
          feels like time is moving more quickly than ever, Marching on. Maybe
          it is all the changes that we are experiencing. Technology and
          information are changing faster than ever and it is a lot to take in.
          But much is the same. The seasons are much the same. The human body
          has not really changed much in 100,000 years. Not even the
          capabilities of our human brains have changed much. The brain and
          nervous system have the miraculous ability to translate and integrate
          and organize all the feelings and information (mostly subconscious)
          that is coming in through all the human senses. When we take the time
          to realize just how much data this is that our miraculous body can
          handle, we know that there is a
          <em
            >Spirit that connects it all, individually and socially, beyond any
            single human's ability to consciously understand it.
          </em>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row mx-auto">
        <p>
          Why is it important to care about this? Well, there are those who want
          to work with these new understandings for the betterment of all human
          life and the environment, and there are those who do not. What is
          needed for humanity to continue to live well is claimed by the Holy in
          Jeremiah 29:11:
          <em
            >"For surely I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, plans
            for your welfare and not for harm, to give you a future with hope." </em
          >We have been given the ability to use our God-given abilities to
          discern together what these plans are for the Holy to give us a future
          with hope. Then, through Christ, we have been given a witness of how
          to go about it: with love and integrity.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row mx-auto">
        <p>
          That sounds like marching orders to me! Each of us has received some
          understanding of the plans that the Lord has for us, for ourselves but
          more importantly for all humanity; we are each called to share what we
          have learned through our various spiritual gifts.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row mx-auto">
        <p>
          This Lenten season, I am called to share what I learn as I integrate
          scripture, theology, and other evidence-based learnings on the subject
          of how we learn and teach. It is important for all of us to share what
          the Holy is calling us to witness to others, especially on how our
          children are being raised and taught.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row mx-auto">
        <p>
          We may each think that there are other people who know more than we
          know, but the reality is that<em>
            it is our integrated understanding that is most important</em
          >. We have many social and cultural "experiments" that we have learned
          from being together as a society and even as a species. Why not take
          the time to listen to one another, especially to those who find
          understanding through evidence-based and time-tested research and
          study. But all of us need to get the basic understanding so that we
          can move forward as a community within other communities in the wisest
          way.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row mx-auto">
        <p>
          As Christians, we feel that this way is for each to care, to strive to
          understand, and to connect our common understanding.
          <em
            >All of us have access to this capacity, these miracles that are our
            body, mind, and spirit</em
          >. Our marching orders are to not sell this short! We are not to give
          away our response-ability to use it and not let it be used or abused
          by others.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row mx-auto">
        <p>
          There is certain wisdom and practical knowledge that we can trust,
          especially when it is tried and true; and there is some that we simply
          can't. Science and theology tell us that it is the evidence-based that
          we can have the most faith in. Christian scripture and discernment
          have given the world helpful social norms. Let us work together to
          figure out what is most important for us to learn together to
          integrate for our common understanding about love, life, and the
          future of humanity that the Holy has been gradually developing for a
          long, long, long time.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row mx-auto">
        <p>
          I have faith in what John Wesley used as a method of integrating
          personal experience, the experience of others, world-wide traditions,
          time-tested scripture, and our God-given ability to reason. I think
          that this is a great method to discern with one another.
          <em
            >Let's create some discussion groups to explore what our God is
            planning for us to discern together for a greater common
            understanding of the Holy Plan for us!</em
