          For the Lenten worship season, including Lenten classes and church
          missions, we will be continuing our response to the violent tragedy
          that happened at the Perry High School on January 4th as we raise our
          awareness about how we are called to act in the world.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row mx-auto">
        <p>
          One thing we hope to glean from scripture is how Christ responded to
          mental or spiritual unwellness. 2000 years ago, society was also
          responding, and Christ responded to these individuals and groups,
          often making grounded proclamations in regard to what he experienced.
          For nearly 2000 years in the Western world, the church has been seen
          by many as the greatest authority on social behavior, answering the
          question, <em>How should I (or we) act in the world?</em>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row mx-auto">
        <p>
          Now we have access to <em>evidence-based learning</em> that measures
          data on specific learning tools and practices, making evident the most
          helpful ways to keep individuals and society mentally and emotionally
          well in health, relationships, and ability to learn. There is evidence
          that shows that most who learn and live these new practiced examples
          can live more healthy, productive, and fulfilling lives. In recent
          years, most public schools have adopted this kind of training for
          teachers and curriculum for students. This helps students of all ages
          to grow strong and well in their minds, in communication, and in their
          emotions. Because of these best practices, classrooms are calmer and
          students can enjoy a better learning environment which they have
          generously given to one another.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row mx-auto">
        <p>
          We will soon have the opportunity to use these new evidenced based
          tools because we will be trained by the public-school approved
          curriculum, <em>The Character Effect,</em> that will be enhanced with
          scripture for Lent in our church. The focus of the worship messages
          and training will be to teach social and emotional learning (SEL).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row mx-auto">
        <p>
          Some of the vocabulary when talking about mental and emotional
          wellness can be triggering to some. The meaning of words like
          <em>mental illness</em> or <em>mental disease</em> or
          <em>prevention</em> keep changing in different settings or in kinds of
          unwellness and the terminology becomes offensive. The power and grace
          of newer, wiser words can be chosen uniquely for different situations,
          and not used as broadly as they have been used in the past. We can
          learn these new more specified words for unique conditions.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row mx-auto">
        <p>
          When my granddaughter was teaching SEL in her school, she took
          attendance by asking the students for an emotional check-in when they
          entered. To learn about their body's messaging system, they were given
          a long list of emotions to choose from to expand the variability of
          the way they could interpret their own emotions. Humans often
          interpret their emotions in limited ways. People only use a few words,
          saying they are happy, sad, mad, afraid, angry, surprised, or
          disgusted. How many more emotions can you name? 20? 50? What about joy
          or exhaustion? Awe or amusement? By learning to identify more emotions
          and figuring out how they present in our bodies, we can gain more
          emotional intelligence and can recognize them more easily in others.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row mx-auto">
        <p>
          By developing better <em>communication</em> with our bodies and minds,
          we can learn to modulate our emotions so we can be more regulated by
          not getting stuck in our emotions that are meant to be fluid. For
          example, as I preach about how important it is for Christians to
          continue to be witnesses and teachers in the community by being
          socially and emotionally healthier, I will probably get butterflies
          from the anxiety of sharing new information. But I will try to see my
          body's presentation of raised heart rate and tightened muscles not as
          anxiety, but as feelings of excitement, so I can get my butterflies to
          fly in formation! Then my anxiety can be released. This is just one
          SEL example that I have learned so far.
