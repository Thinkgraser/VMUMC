              <ul>
                <li>
                  Kids Care is a not-for-profit DHS licensed childcare center for
                  elementary-age students.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is an outreach ministry of the Van Meter United Methodist
                  Church to Van Meter and surrounding communities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is our purpose to provide quality before and after school
                  child care to elementary children. We will help develop
                  character-building traits such as respect, responsibility, and
                  charity to others through organized activities, including Bible
                  stories, devotions, and prayer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Our activities will foster an awareness of Christ, such as
                  actions and attitudes in our response to others and self. We
                  will strive to create an atmosphere where the connections
                  between faith and life can be made.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We operate a facility to meet the needs of children in
                  compliance with the law of the State of Iowa.
