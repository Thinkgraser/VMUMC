          The current Van Meter United Methodist Church is a community of people
          that have come together through mergers of several earlier
          congregations. In 1847 the first ministers were serving the settlers
          in the central portion of the new state of Iowa. These ministers were
          circuit riders and traveled a route from settlement to settlement to
          hold worship services. By the 1870s the congregations of the circuit
          riders began building permanent church buildings to provide shelter
          for the people who were worshiping in homes and tents.

          Union Chapel United Brethren was built in 1873 southeast of Van Meter
          at the corner of Badger Creek Road and 105th Street. In 1943 that
          congregation joined the Van Meter United Brethren Church. That church
          building is now a private residence.

          Van Meter United Brethren Church was built at the corner of Main and
          Ellis Streets in 1874. The Evangelical and United Brethren
          congregations combined in 1946 and became the Van Meter Evangelical
          United Brethren Church. In 1969 the Methodist and the Evangelical
          United Brethren (EUB) congregations combined becoming United
          Methodists. This combined congregation was then renamed Otterbein
          United Methodist Church. Worship services were alternated monthly
          between this building and the First United Methodist Church. This
          building is now the Van Meter Baptist Church.

          Van Meter Methodist Church was built in 1882 on the corner of Elm and
          1st Streets. The structure was renamed First United Methodist Church
          in 1968. With the merger of the Methodist and EUB congregations in
          1969 services were alternated monthly with the Otterbein United
          Methodist Church. This building is now an apartment building on the
          corner of Elm and Wilson streets, located near the Van Meter school.

          In the early 1970s a new building was planned and constructed on the

          in 1974 and is the current location of the Van Meter United Methodist
          Church. A Fellowship Hall was added and consecrated in 1996.

          In 2021, we were given five acres of land near the Van Meter school
          from a memorial bequest of some of our beloved members. We have yet to
          decide its use for our ministry. Like all gifts, it will be discerned
          and developed through the dance of the Holy Spirit in artistry of our
